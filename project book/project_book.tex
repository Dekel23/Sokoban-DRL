\chapter*{Abstract}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a cornerstone of modern technology, driving advancements in areas such as autonomous systems, robotics, and adaptive control.\\
However, a critical challenge in deploying RL algorithms lies in their tendency to suffer from convergence issues, particularly in complex, high-dimensional environments where instability can lead to suboptimal or unsafe policies.\\
This project aims to explore the impact of formal verification techniques on RL, specifically focusing on how these methods can address the convergence challenges that plague RL systems.\\
We will empirically investigate this by applying formal verification to a model-free RL algorithm designed to solve the Sokoban puzzle game, a notoriously difficult problem requiring complex planning and decision-making.\\

\chapter{Background}
In this chapter, we introduce the fundamental concepts that critical for the reader to understand.
We will provide deep understanding of Neural Networks (NN), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep Q-Learning (DQL), and Fomal Verification.
